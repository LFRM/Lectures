#Consider the Hitters data in the ISLR library.

#a) use the pls library and compute PCR to explain Salary in terms of all variables in the data set. Select scale = TRUE to scale the variables and validation = "CV". 

#b) How many components do we need to explain at least 90% of the variance in the design matrix?

#c) Repeat part b) using pls. Do we need the same number of components?
