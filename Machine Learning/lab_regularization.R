#Consider the Hitters data in the ISLR library.

#a) Use the glmnet function in the glmnet library to fit a ridge regression for lambda = 0.7, and compare this with the results from lm.

#b) select the best lambda with the validation set approach, using half of the observations for training and half for test. 

#c) Report the test MSE associated with the  value of Î» found in part b

#d) repeat part a), b and c) using lasso instead of ridge regression
