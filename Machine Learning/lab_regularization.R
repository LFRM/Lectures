#Consider the Hitters data in the ISLR library.

#a) Use the glmnet function in the glmnet library to fit a ridge regression for lambda = 0.7, and compare this with the results from lm.

#b) select the best lambda with the validation set approach, using half of the observations for training and half for test. Report the test MSE associated with this value of Î»

#c) re-estimate the ridge regression model with the lambda found in part b

#d) repeat part a) using lasso instead of ridge regression
